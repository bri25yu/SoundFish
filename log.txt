    - recording past high scores and usernames
    - weapons: weapon class, snapping
    - hermit crab rarity (1 per level)
    - hermit crab animations for interactions
    - swimming/floating animation
    - hermit crab (shield +1 life?), electric eel (shoots out electricity in ellipsoid), starfish (slow - weight on scaling factor) interactions
    - octopus vertical tracking movement (weighted average)
    - shifting bubbles, moving background
        - background add transparency (alpha >> 0 - less distracting)
    - nonlinear acceleration
    - ?? multiplayer (tag team system) ??
    - ?? voice hoarseness test perhaps ??
    - jelly fish that sting you
 - next session:
    - shifting background
    - Menu
    - pitch and decibel movement mechanism + setting in Menu
    - portal
    - calibration in menu
    - noise cancelling headphones type thing to avoid feedback of yayy and awwww
    - fish eats pill gets superpowers (temp sort of jetpack joyride vehicle thing)
